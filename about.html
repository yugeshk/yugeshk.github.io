## About

If you've found your way to this page, you're probably trying to get to know more about me. First things first : vim > emacs

Hi, my name is Yugesh Kothari. I am an incoming PhD student at EPFL, Switzerland. I completed my undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. 
I am a tech enthusiast; broadly interested in software systems, software verification, programming languages and cloud systems. I am fairly proficient at full stack and systems development. I am hooked to learning devops. I install linux on laptops in my spare time (that is not an expression). I like to characterize myself as a geek-strovert (yes, I coined the term). I love conversations about technology, politics and philosophy. Judge me all you want, but I loved the Indian version of "The Office". Side Note, I put the _pro_ in procrastination.

In another world, I was a (self-proclaimed) brilliant science student when I appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination (_supposedly the toughest in the world_) where I managed to sneak by with a rank of 120 (among almost a million candidates, so maybe that was impressive).
