## About

If you've found your way to this page, you're probably trying to get to know more about me.

Hi, my name is Yugesh Kothari. I am a rising junior at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I am a tech enthusiast, broadly interested in software systems, programming languages and cloud systems. I am farily proficient at full stack and systems development. I am hooked to learning devops. I like to characterize myself as a geek-strovert (yes, I coined the term). I love conversations about technology, politics and philosophy. Judge me all you want, but I loved the Indian version of "The Office". Side Note, I put the _pro_ in procrastination.

In another world, I was a (self-proclaimed) brilliant science student when I appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination (_supposedly the toughest in the world_) where I managed to sneak by with a rank of 120 (in almost a million, so maybe that was impressive).
