## Research

I am currently working as a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/"> Max Planck Institute for Software Systems</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://mariachris.github.io/">Dr. Maria Christakis</a>. 
I am broadly interested in software verification tools and techniques, and their applications to computer systems. My professional goals are centered around making software more reliable.
