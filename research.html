## Research

I am currently working as a doctoral research assistant at <a href="http://dslab-epfl.github.io/">Dependable Systems Lab, EPFL</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://dslab.epfl.ch/people/candea/">Prof. George Candea</a>. I am broadly interested in software verification tools and techniques, and their applications to computer systems. My professional goals are centered around making software more reliable.
